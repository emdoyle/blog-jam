### An imperfect information game
No-limit Texas Hold'em in its purest form is a zero-sum, imperfect
information game with an expansive and dynamic meta-game. The strategies which
emerge can be examined for useful insights in other, similar games, including
many that come up frequently in social life.

This post aims to be understandable with only a very rough understanding
of how NLHE (No Limit Hold'em) works. An in-depth explanation is available
in a bunch of places on the internet including (here). The TL;DR is that
every player at a table has some chips (money), and are dealt cards that are
hidden from the other players. Each player then has an opportunity to
bet some of their chips if they believe their hand will be best, or to
convince other players of the same.

Since each player has their own cards hidden, the game is one of 'imperfect
information'. Since one player's winnings on a hand are another player's losses
(excluding the house cut...) the game is zero-sum.

The real complexity and skill in the game come from the act of 'bluffing':
exploiting the imperfect information to win a hand with worse cards.
